In my Expectation in System Integration and Architecture class, I really want to understand how different software and hardware parts work together in complex systems. Iâ€™m excited to learn about the principles and methods behind designing and connecting these systems so they run smoothly and reliably. 
I think this will help me see the real challenges in making different technologies talk to each other and work as a team. I also look forward to getting some hands-on experience with the tools and frameworks used in system integration. Working on practical projects should give me the skills to analyze existing setups, find where systems connect, and come up with solutions to make them faster and better at handling more tasks.
This approach will help me connect what I learn in theory with real-world situations. In the end, I hope this course will make me better at thinking critically and planning strategies for designing and managing integrated systems in a professional setting. My goal is to build a solid foundation that will support my growth in the IT field and help me contribute meaningfully to projects that involve complex system setups and integration issues.
